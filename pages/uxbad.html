          <h3>Let's take a look at some areas with room for improvement!</h3>
          <p>At UNA, there are lots of drivers that consist of students, professors, other staff, and visitors that park on campus. With the minimal parking spaces available, it is truly important for an individual to have their vehicle in the UNA Parking Portal system. If a vehicle is not in the system or in their designated parking location, penalties are in place. </p><br>
          <p>I commute an hour to and from campus daily, so I am putting a lot of miles on my vehicle. Because of this, my car gets serviced pretty regularly. When my vehicle is getting serviced, I have to go through the UNA Parking Portal and update my parking profile as I am in a temporary vehicle. The process takes longer than it should. The current interface to add a vehicle works, but has a few issues that make the interface difficult to navigate.</p><br>

          <br><p>As you can see, the screen features a pre-existing number in the textbox when the user is supposed to enter the "Year" of the vehicle. If one looks at the screen as a whole, there are many textboxes on the "Add New Vehicle" screen that consists of pre-existing text. For the purpose of this assignment, we will focus on looking at the "Year" of the vehicle.</p>
          <img class ="addScreen" src="../img/UNA_error.png" alt="Example of one error with text" width= '250' height= '100'>
          <p><br>This feature on the form features a drop-down box that is difficult to look at and takes up a good portion of the screen. It also requires the user to empty the characters locatated in the textbox beforehand. This small step when adding a vehicle is more time-consuming than it should be. </p><br/>
          <p>In order to recieve the most accurate information possible, the form should allow users to input information with no hassle. Of course, each textbox that is shown above should implement the same design to help save time and be less irritating to the user. Furthermore, fewer drop-down boxes will make the form easier to navigate.</p>
