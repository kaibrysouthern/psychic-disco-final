          <p><br>Each semester, UNA students look forward to classes ending and summer beginning. However, one roadblock always appears in their way -course evaluations. While these used to be paper forms with fill-in blanks and bubbles, UNA has recently begun using electronic surveys to collect data. However, the online course evaluations are not user-friendly.<br> At best, they are cumbersome and annoying. At worst, they can discourage students from completing them or cause incorrect information to be provided.</p><br>
          <p>Many of the screens are misleading to students; however, one of the worst offenders is the screen that asks various questions regarding the student's hours spent and the grade anticipated.</p><br>
          <img class ="addScreen" src="../img/UNA_add_vehicle.png" alt="Adding a vehiicle">
          <br><p>As you can see, the screen features four drop-down boxes that collect student input. For the purpose of this assignment, and because it would take a very long time to re-design the whole survey, I will focus on one question. The format of this question can be applied to the other questions within the survey, as needed.</p>
          <img class ="addScreen" src="../img/UNA_error.png" alt="Example of one error with text">
          <p><br>As you can see, this question, like many others throughout this survey, features a drop-down box that is repetitive and takes up a good portion of the screen.</p><br/>
          <p>However, this specific question has another underlying problem with the way that the answers are designed. The answers are in the popular A+ / A- form. This grading system is not widely used at UNA, and it leaves answers open to interpretation, as students may have different opinions on what deserves an A- and what grade does not. Furthermore, the inclusion of a GPA scale on the answers may lead students to believe that this question is somehow referring to their overall average.</p>
          <p>In order to recieve the most accurate information possible, the survey should be designed to present specific answers based on student input. This way, answers will be more precise, and students will not feel frustrated by vague, confusing answers. Furthermore, fewer drop-down boxes will make the survey feel less repetitive.</p>
